# ... a bit more detail

**AI kickstarts** are straight-forward AI examples built for deployment on
your Red Hat platform. Think of them as ready-to-run, turnkey examples showing
real use cases and innovations using open source software. They're here to
jump-start your journey and help you get the most out of Red Hat AI.


Many of these examples come straight from Red Hat AI experts. After all, this is
our day job! Contributions from Red Hat partners and the community are not just
welcome, they are *encouraged*!
